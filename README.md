**new_folder(2)** formed under the common banner of learning to use Godot to make a 3D game. Our team consists of brilliant minds like Michalis The Neversleeping, Karita of Brilliant Textures, Hans, Merged with Code and Models, Symphonic Wonder Otto, Tuomas who Conquered Time and Rasmus Who Governs the Questions. 

The theme during this jam was "Roots" which we took literally. Our game takes it's inspiration from soulslike games' combat, and our goal was to learn how to use Godot to recreate different features to make a full experience.
The WASD keys are used for movement, left click for attacking, right click and hold for lock-on, space for jumping and Q for rolling. 

I hope you enjoy our product, and we appreciate any feedback for the game.
